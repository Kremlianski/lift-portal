# lift-portal

## Content Management System based on Scala, Lift, PostgreSQL, TypeScript and Slick

+ **Scala** is a wonderful language!

+ **Lift** is the best web framework I've met in my life!

+ **PostgreSQL** is the best database!

+ **Slick** is great!

+ Plus my experience of doing the same things with Java and JavaScript.

Summarizing all mentioned above I hope to get an excellent CMS. Wish me a luck!

## Development stage. There is nothing to see yet...
